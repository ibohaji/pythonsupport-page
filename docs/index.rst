Welcome to the DTU student support unit!  
We are here to help with Python installation problems related
to courses at DTU.

   Re-insert this when we have a common guideline.
   When encountering the icon {{ pref_symbol }} you are using the
   recommended DTU Python installation procedure.

Our goal is to ensure that students can get a Python
environment up and running according to the needs of DTU courses.  
Help can be requested through various channels:

   Should these (below) be here? Or is the above enough?

Office hours
   we will have physical presence at DTU Lyngby campus on differing locations
   depending on the used lecture rooms in the Polytechnical Foundation courses.
   See further down for our locations during specific weeks of the semester.
   This page will be updated continuously.

Mail -- :mail:`pythonsupport@dtu.dk`  |  {{online_days}} in the evening
   Outside of office hours we can be contacted through emails. We strive to return
   answers as soon as possible.

Discord -- `channel <ps-discord-general_>`_ and `invite link <ps-discord-invite_>`_  |  {{online_days}} in the evening
   Our support team will also be present on the Discord chat service.

   Using the Discord channel requires signing up to Discord's terms, DTU
   has no control over Discord and how they use your data. If you feel uncomfortable
   about signing up, please use the email or the physical meet-ups.
